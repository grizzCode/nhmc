    <p>Steve Monson found a passion for sailing on the shores of Bear Lake as a Boy Scout counselor at Camp Hunt.  He spent much of his youth
      teaching scouts the finer points of rigging and sailing Sunfish and Hobie Cats. The unique combination of discipline required to
      properly rig and sail a boat, and the incredible feeling of independence, freedom and peace that comes from doing it well showed
      Steve the potential for sailing as a tutor for kids learning to live a good life.

      you can find him on the water racing his Olson 30, out on a run, climbing a local trail on a mountain bike, or playing tennis with
      his wife and three boys.
